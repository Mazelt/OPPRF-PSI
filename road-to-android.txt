Questions:
* strip server code from android library?
* Build in android studio or not?

Plan: 
* compile libpsi_analytics_eurocrypt19 for android (arm64-v8a, android-28, OP5)
    * requires: ABY, libOTe, HashingTables, GMP
                Encrypto_utils, OTExtension, Relic,
                OpenSSL, Boost, NTL
    * use/adpat oliver-schick ABY for Android (Encrypto_utils,OTExtension)
* Use libpsi_analytics_eurocrypt19 in mini app.
* Design interface functions for jni
* Create prototype app that runs psi with mobile client desktop server
* Setup benchmarking scripts
* Do benchmarking
* Improve? sse for android? Update NTL
* Evaluate
* Mock up contact tracing app around psi.

Not yet compiled to android:
* libOTe, main psi_analytics_eurocrypt19 project.

Problems: 
* android-ndk and cmake: meh. where is boost?
* any server-specific code needed to be scrapped from code when building for the
android client?
* oliver-schick forks full of unecessary changes
* x86 intrinsics

Questions:
* Build libpsi_analytics_eurocrypt19 in android-studio with gradle-cmake or
console cmake?


## Static or shared library.

### Runtime
If all of your application's native code is contained in a single shared
library, we recommend using the static runtime.
https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support#static_runtimes 
This allows the linker to inline and prune as much unused code as possible.

But One Definition Rule: not safe to define more than one copy of the same
funciton or object in a single program. When using a static runtime it is easy
to accidentally break this rule.

IN GENERAL, YOU CAN ONLY USE A STATIC VARIANT OF THE C++ RUNTIME IF YOU HAVE ONE
AND ONLY ONE SHARED LIBRARY IN YOUR APPLICATION.
single shared library -> use static runtime for efficiency.
multiple shared libraries -> undefined behaviour when linking static runtime.

Be safe and use shared runtime?

Only one STL per App!
All dependencies must use the same STL. (GNU libstdc++, STLport, libc++)

Cmake default is c++_static. Specify c++_shared,c++static,none,system using ANDROID_STL.




Packages:
glib-2.0 (psi_analytics_eurocrypt19/CMakeLists.txt)
    not sure where this is used. Should just try compiling without it to see what is breaking


psi_analytics_eurocrypt19
    Mersenne.h uses x86 intrinsics: port via https://github.com/jratcliff63367/sse2neon
        its using the _mulx_u64 intrinsic to compute lower and higher u64 ints of a u64 int multiplication.
        there does not seem to be an intrinis for aarch64. I commented an inline function suggested in a thread.


works already:
libOTe
    cryptoTools
    boost 
    relic built with pthread
    disable nasm compiler, enable relic
    simplestot
    Can use SSE, with
    https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon/tree/5e8330447570410b05a86efc72e80538908fb56a
    latest commits have a bug.
    exchange all <*intrin.h> with "sse2neon.h"
    compiler settings -march=armv8-a+fp+simd+crypto+crc
     https://blog.michaelbrase.com/2018/05/08/emulating-x86-aes-intrinsics-on-armv8-a/
    use c++_shared for ANDROID_STL.

hashingtables (cmake, static) Used android cmake toolchain file. worked with find_package(OpenSSL CONFIG REQUIRED).
    fmt (header only! (does this require the lib on android? its marked as PRIVATE))
    openssl
ABY 
    ext: encrypto_utils
        ext: relic_s
    ext: otextension
Encrypto_utils
    openssl
    boost
gmp
gmpxx
ntl (hard...)
    https://github.com/nemirst/ntl-android has a port for ntl 9.6.2 ndk 14.
    needs static gmp (gmp.a)
    ntl 9.6.2 with ndk 21 android-28
relic_s (already part of encrypto, static)
Threads:threads



BOOST! 
using the android toolchain file changes many things like some root paths.
i got back to just changing the boost library file locations so it matches the
places where cmake looks.
${ANDROIDNDK}/boost/ where the lib files are located with an include/ directory
holding boost_1_72/boost/
I used arguments '-DCMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE=ON' to debug the locations


gmp: copied gmp lib/includes to ${ANDROID_NDK}/gmp
Edited set(GMP_LIBRARY_DIR "${CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK}/gmp/lib")
set(GMP_INCLUDES "${CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK}/gmp/include") 
in opprf/extern/ABY/cmake/Modules/AddGMP.cmake

For aby: 
i did rework the whol oliver-schick repo chain: ABY, Encrypto_utils,
OTExtension.
Cleaned it up.
Used cmake gui to set android properties. Fixed errors.
ABY builds now.
Overall trick. copy dependencies  into ANDROID_NDK space and use ROOT_DIR
properties for cmake. 


SSE2NEON.
This proves rather hard. Let's focus on getting mersenne to work and leave sse
out of it. 
When building cryptoTools with SSE the sse2neon.h has errors for calls like
vshlq_n_s64 with a non-constant shift (n). There is a workaround (using negative
shift with a function that can handle this variable shift but only right shift?)
