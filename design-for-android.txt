TODO:
* Implement PSI with associated values.
* Write test for associated values PSI.
* Implement Overlap setting
* Add random associated values
* Prepare server binary for risk scoring.
* Make associates values view/editable
* Compute risk score using PSI-SUM
* Embed weights into the scoring
* prepare benchmarking (parameter combinations)
* gather more data: profiler, memory, energy?, time, data.

DONE
* UI to configure the context
* JNI entrypoints to configure the context
* Threading for jni calls and UI.
* Tweak UI: disable button after press.
* Return/view results of execution in app.
* Enable/Investigate own elements.
* Create Contact Tracing UI
* Get SUM output viewable.

Own elements: we should reuse the GeneratePseudoRandom and enable an overlap
setting. Both client and server use the same seed with an offset that comprises
the overlap between the two sets.
